Version: 0.1.0
Author: J. T. Atria
Maintainer: J. T. Atria <jtatria@nomoi.org>
Description: Collection of useful primitives for euclidean geometry, developed with a focus on
    separation of low level computing implementations and high-level algebraic and geometric
    operations, in order to eventually allow for easy extension to different computing backends.
